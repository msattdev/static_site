# MSattDev — Project Portfolio

**Welcome!** This repository contains a static, self‑contained portfolio website. The site showcases projects, contact information, and a few small interactive widgets — more projects and updates are coming soon. ✅

---

## What's included 🔧

- `index.html` — main page and content
- `css/style.css` — site styling
- `js/` — small UI scripts (progress bar, projects rendering, clock)
- `img/` — static assets

---

## New: Futuristic redesign ✨

- Updated styling with neon accents, animated gradient overlays, and reveal/hover micro-interactions.
- Background canvas particle effect (disabled when the user prefers reduced motion or on small screens to save battery).
- Theme toggle (dark/light) saved to localStorage and accessible via the header button.
- Dark mode is now the default (overrides OS preference by default; users can toggle in the header).
- Accessibility: respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and provides clear focus outlines for keyboard users.
